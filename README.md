# Userscript
Userscript alternative for the P-Stream extension. (90% compatability)

1. Install a user script extension (e.g., Violentmonkey)
2. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p-stream/Userscript/main/p-stream.user.js) the script!
3. Enable it for P-Stream!

This does not currently work in Safari or Orion due to Webkit’s limitations with webRequest APIs. :(

Thanks to Duplicake for the incredible help building this!
